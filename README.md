# hauntingground
A decompilation project of Haunting Ground for the PlayStation 2. This will be intended for Windows 10/11, Mac and Linux.
Running the compiled executable requires PCSX2 2.0. You must have your own copy of the original game and the BIOS from your own PS2. They are not included in this repo and we cannot provide them for you.
